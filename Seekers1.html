        <att>The Seekers I: Valley of Kings - featuring Team SPG</att> 

        		 <ats>
		  		Team Seek Power Gaming is poised to capture several top spots in both the Eternal Tournament Series and the Eternal Community League. 
				<br /><br />
				In this first part of a series, we talk to SPG members SooNo, BruisedByGod and SecondBlue about what it means to be a team player of Eternal.
			</ats>

			<br />
			
			<atsub>
				As of this writing: BruisedByGod, SecondBlue, and SooNo are all ranked in the Top 20 in <em>both</em> ECL and ECS. BruisedByGod is in second place for 2018 Series Points in the ETS, with SecondBlue right behind, and teammate ChildRoland taking the top spot. SooNo is current frontrunner for ECL’s inaugural season

			<ath>Dream Team</ath>
			<br />

	        <iq>
				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
    		    		SPG appears to be currently dominating the ranks in both ETS and ECL. How much of this would you say is due to the strength of the individual players compared to working together as a team?
			</iq>

			<br /><br />

	        <strong>SooNo: </strong><br />
			We’re all strong players as stand alones, which is a big part of us being asked to join SPG. But as far as success after joining SPG, it is all due to the team.
			<br />
	        <br />

	        <strong>BruisedByGod:</strong><br />
			I would say that the strength of a player is so dependent on who they are playing with and [who they are] talking to. It is more or less impossible to separate the two. 
			<br />
	        <br />
			Even if I am coming up with a deck and playing it by myself, the player I am is still in part a result of my teammates.
			<br />
	        <br />

	        <strong>SecondBlue:</strong><br />
			I was actually a better player before I joined your team. [Laughter]
			<br />
	        <br />

			Kidding aside, being on a team increases the strength of the individual players. We compete against other teams and players, but most importantly against each other.  
			<br /><br />
			This certainly motivates me to bring decks that I feel will be able to compete with my teammates for bragging rights amongst ourselves.
			<br /><br />

	        <strong>SooNo: </strong><br />
			BruisedByGod and I have been a duo on: deck building, theory crafting, tuning, testing  and really everything that pertains to Eternal. Although he likes to throw me on ladder and perch while I lose with some nonsense he’s constructed.
			<br /><br />

<!--	        <iq>
				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
				So SooNo is the lab rat?
			</iq>

			<br /><br />

	        <strong>SooNo: </strong><br />
			If SPG has a lab rat, I'm definitely it hahaha. But the old saying two heads are better than one is very real. And when you have most of the best minds in the game as SPG does in your corner, it is fairly hard to do poorly.
			<br /><br /><br />
			
			Internal rivalries
We get paired against each other so much that , we have to be thinking about that all the tieme

SecondBlue: team demands attention

Q: Anything else you care to say about the SPG team structure or what it is like to be part of a team?

-->

	        <iq>
				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
    		    		Hahaha. Let's take a closer look at some of that nonsense, and then talk some more about what it means to be a team player in Eternal.
			</iq>
			<br /><br /><br />

			<ath>Pharaoh Play: Taharqa Mid</ath>
			<atsub>One tournament, one deck, two players, two top eight finishes </atsub>
			<br />

			<img alt="Decklist" src="images/TaharqaMidDecklist.jpeg" style="margin-right: 900px; position: absolute; left: 70px; top: 1500px; float: left; width: 260px; height: 754px;" /> 
			<img alt="Influence Chart" src="images/TaharqaMid.jpeg" style="width: 840px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;" title="Influence Chart" />

<!--				SooNo: (Taraq mid what you have typed out is not what i want associated with, yea you want tt turn 2 but needing 1 t turn 3 is null and void if were casting a scribe turn 2... so that just feels like an attempt to bash but its a mute point really as how the deck is.... if you want to say tt scribe turn 2 and ss for ayan turn 3 that makes more s ense pertaining to a power base and my answer to that would be im a greed ball that enjoys rolling the dice sometimes but its honest fine with 12 duals and seeks)
					What problems was SooNo trying to solve by adding one additional Shadow source?

					SooNo: I cut a TT card for a Shadow card kinda self explanatory as to why I added a shadow source. I did zero testing with this deck cause it was a joke, but I love Hall of Lost Kings. So BBG just used a weakness of mine against me and got me to play it. [Talk more about this]
					
					Was this based on testing, intuition, personal preference, something else?

					SooNo: I made the changes based on preference. I’m a more “sit back play it safe” kinda guy and BBG is more “gungho kill you dead now”.
					II) SooNo identified this Xenan list as “bbg’s deck”:

					SooNo: (Your part 2 I'll let bbg answer because we just jammed the deck we didnt think about it to too in depth honest. I wouldn’t bring this to an event I care about winning). 
					Brings up the question: is “Casual Friday” still casual now that it counts for ECL points?

					What was the original inspiration for the deck?

					BruisedByGod: I made it because I like messing around with Hall of Lost Kings and Mask of Torment. It can do some nasty things if it can hold off early pressure and you keep your life total up.

					SooNo: BruisedByGod has soft spot for Mask of Torment. I have a soft spot for Hall of Lost Kings. And we like to tilt SecondBlue by not playing Auric Interrogator or Xenan Obelisk.
					BruisedByGod: It was made mostly as a meme deck. But this [event] was sort of a test to see if it could go beyond that. Because I have played Hall of Lost Kings at a high level before. And with some new cards in this expansion, I thought I could maybe take it the next level.  I knew from SooNo's performance that Hall of Lost Kings could have success at the highest levels of competitive play.

					Was it built specifically as a tournament deck or for other purposes?

					What was the process for sharing/testing/modifying among SPG team members?

				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
				SooNo took third place a recent ECL tournament with this Xenan that list he dubbed <em>Taharqa Mid</em>. BruisedByGod also finished in the Top 8 in the same event with a nearly identical deck. What was the original inspiration for the deck?
			</iq>
			<br /><br />

	        <br />

	        <iq>
				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
				SooNo’s version is nearly identical to BruisedByGod’s apart from two small changes:
				<br /> <br />

				-1 Vital Arcana, +1 Annihilate<br />
				+1 Shadow Sigil, -1 Time Sigil
				<br /><br />

				SooNo, what contributed to your decision to make these subtle changes?
			</iq>
				<br /><br />

		        <strong>SooNo: </strong><br />
				Well I added an Annihilate for the reason there’s this card that enjoys teaching people. And i just didn’t want to be learning from her. 
				<br /><br />

	        <iq>
				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
				There is a nice balance between Power sources (22 of each color). The Vara’s Favors even out the Amber Waystones, and both make a lot of sense in a deck that includes Beckoning Lumen and Hall of the Lost Kings. 
				<br /><br />
				Would you say this type of symmetrical distribution is intentional or does it just happen naturally?
			</iq>
			<br /><br />

		        <strong>SooNo: </strong><br />
				It's funny, I did the same thing to another one of BBG’s Xenan decks which I won with. And he had to point it out to me as you did.
				<br /><br />
				Because when I looked at the deck, it just felt correct in my gut pertaining to changes I made. And the fact they’re evenly split is just a coincidence.
				<br /><br />

			<ath>Let the ritual commence</ath>
			<atsub>...whenever the game state is ready that is</atsub>
				<br />

	        <iq>
				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
				It is also Interesting to note that in a "health matters" deck  there is only one copy of Katra, the Devoted (in the Market). Not including more copies of Katra in the main deck is an unexpected choice (though it seems to have paid off). 
				<br /><br />
				What was the thinking there?
			</iq>
				<br /><br />

		        <strong>SooNo: </strong><br />
				Katra is just a "better" Xenan Obelisk in this deck, or at least we hoped haha.
				<br /><br />

		        <strong>BruisedByGod:</strong><br />
				Katra is a better version of Obelisk if you can get her down and protect her. But she is very dead when you are under a lot of pressure and don't have any ways to pump her on the board. The reason to only have one is so that she will not be dead when you draw multiples without activators. 
				<br /><br />
				But you keep the explosive potential of Katra by having one in the market when you have the game state that allows room for her to be played. And in those situations she is unmatched.
				<br /><br />

	        <iq>
				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
				It is refreshing to see a successful Xenan list that is not Xenan Killers. Do you intend to continue playing and refining this deck going forward?
			</iq>
				<br /><br />

		        <strong>SooNo: </strong><br />
				As far as improving this deck I feel only new cards, buffs or nerfs can do that. But BBG and i have done well with Xenan lists that are not Killers before. We’ll do it again, you’ll just have to wait and see haha.
				<br /><br />

		        <strong>BruisedByGod:</strong><br />
				Yes. I have hope that one day two color Mask of Torment will be a tier 1 deck. But I do not see it working as a top deck with the current card pool.

			<br />

	        <iq>
				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
				Over half the players are participating in both leagues, which can be a demanding schedule - potentially up to four days a week. What motivates or inspires you to participate?
			</iq>
			<br /><br />

	        <strong>SooNo: </strong><br />
			I participate in whatever I can. I come from a Magic, the Gathering background. I’m used to playing in events six nights a week, and the seventh it was team drafting. So ETS and ECL have filled a little bit of my competitive itch. But I got a whole lot more that needs scratched haha.
			<br /><br />

	        <strong>BruisedByGod:</strong><br />
			I enjoy the game and in particular playing tournaments alongside my teammates. The discord calls make putting in the time worth it. Other than that, I like winning especially when I can do it my own way.
			<br /><br />

	        <strong>SecondBlue:</strong><br />
			Personally I can't attend as many tournaments as I would like to due to a need to study.  However the tournaments I do attend are heavily prepared for. 
			<br /><br />
			And I am motivated by a fear of failure.  As a team we generally demand attendance, so it's quite expected to attend tournaments of importance for most of SPG.
			<br /><br />

	        <iq>
				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
				How much preparation/practicing do you do as a team, vs. just showing up to participate in an event?
			</iq>
			<br /><br />

	        <strong>SooNo: </strong><br />
				We do a lot of in team practice, brainstorm meetings, daily chit chat among us. And any help someone needs or wants, we make sure to be there for them. 
				<br /><br />
				As I said before, we’re strong stand alone players. But when we work together, we go from strong players to one of the top teams in the game. Team work makes the dream work.
			<br /><br />

	        <iq>
				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
				Do team members consult with each other about what decks they will be bringing to a tournament? Or is that left up to the individual players? 
			</iq>
			<br /><br />

	        <strong>SooNo: </strong><br />
				We are always consulting each other on what to bring, how the event may look, and what this means for what we need to do. Or what new deck if any people want to try. There’s a lot. We do a lot as a team. 
				<br /><br />
				That’s the whole point of being on one in the first place. You can join a team, say nothing, present nothing, test with noone, and do your own thing. But at that point you’re not on a team, and I’d be willing to bet you wouldn’t survive the long run alone.
			<br /><br />

	        <strong>BruisedByGod:</strong><br />
				We have a discord tab where we share lists among teammembers.  What might be unique about this channel is how frequently lists are posted and updated.  
				<br /><br />
				People will post concepts and than others will play them and help to fine tune lists.  The activity in that channel is really the heart of SPG.
			<br /><br />

	        <strong>SooNo: </strong><br />
			 I think its more like the arms or legs. [Laughter] The players are the heart of SPG, and the bond that we share.
