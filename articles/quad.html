        <h0g>QUADROPHENIA:<br />
        Four decks, four Power bases, one winner</h0g> <subhead>Camat0 sits down with Shiftstoned to discuss his four winning decks from the&nbsp;<br />
        Eternal Community League&#39;s inaugural Sunday Challenge event.&nbsp;We talk Power,<br />
        Crests, fixing and the merits of Privilege of Rank.</subhead><h1g>The New Icaria Black: FJS Control</h1g><strong>Camat0&rsquo;s</strong> <em>Removal Pile</em>, updated for the <strong>Fall of Argenport</strong>. How has the <strong>Power</strong> base changed and what makes it even better now?</pg> <img alt="Influence Chart" src="images/FJSControl.jpeg" style="width: 840px; margin: 0px 70px 0px 105px;" title="Influence Chart" /> <pg><strong>Shiftstoned:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
        You chose this list for one of your four decks on Sunday as part of the event&#39;s Conquest format. But the origins of it stretch back a while...<br />
        <br />
        <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
        This is the first deck I built with the <strong>Fall of Argenport</strong>. In fact I built this deck the day after <strong>Fall of Argenport</strong> was legal, and it has changed very little from there.<br />
        <br />
        But this version of<strong> FJS</strong> is basically an updated version of <em>Removal Pile</em>, the deck I made to break the <strong>Tavrod</strong> meta back in early 2018.<br />
        <br />
        At that time, manuS and I finished first and second in the <strong>Eternal Tournament Series S#W#</strong> with that version of the deck, the first tournament we ever played it.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
        Since then, some things have changed in the way <strong>Power</strong> bases are built in <strong>Eternal</strong>. One of the major differences between this list and the previous versions appears to be the inclusion of all 12 available <strong>Crests</strong>.<br />
        <br />
        How do you think this has improved the deck? Has it changed the way you play <strong>FJS</strong> control?<br />
        <br />
        <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
        <strong>Crests</strong> changed the game at a fundamental level. They not only made every <strong>Control</strong> and <strong>Midrange</strong> deck more consistent, but they also allow <strong>Control</strong> decks to play more <strong>Power</strong> without flooding out.<br />
        <br />
        Now that we have all the <strong>Crests</strong>, I think every <strong>Control</strong> deck that plays three colors should play at least one or two more <strong>Power</strong> cards than they used too. In the end I find more <strong>Power</strong> makes your deck work better in every way now.<br />
        <br />
        Also the existence of <strong>Crests</strong> makes it really hard to justify two color <strong>Control</strong> decks any more. You want the <strong>Crest</strong> even if they are off-color, and at that point splashing another color is just too easy.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Shiftstoned: </strong><br />
        It is also interesting to note that you added an extra copy of <strong>Privilege of Rank</strong> (a&nbsp; valuable discard target in addition to being a <strong>Power</strong> source), while at the same time removing <strong>Quarry</strong> (a powerful discard effect).<br />
        <br />
        <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
        People play <strong>Privilege of Rank</strong> only because it has synergy with <strong>Bulletshaper</strong> or other discard effects, when the truth is that the card is just good.<br />
        <br />
        I&#39;m happy to hard cast the card in a lot of decks, but most people don&#39;t and I think that is why it was so underplayed.<br />
        <h1g>The Boogeyman: Call Me Maybe</h1g><strong>Camat0&rsquo;s</strong> <em>Call Me Maybe</em> is a complicated list with a <strong>Power</strong> base that has seen much refinement since its early origins as a <em>Charge Rod</em> deck.</pg><img alt="Influence Chart" src="images/CallMeMaybe.jpeg" style="width: 840px; margin: 0px 70px 0px 105px;" title="Influence Chart" /><br />
        <br />
        <pg> <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
        For a while now, <strong>Divining Rod</strong> has allowed players to cheat out units that their <strong>Power</strong> base wouldn&rsquo;t normally support by playing them from the deck rather than from hand - but it has remained somewhat of a fringe strategy. What is different now?
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
          The key for <em>Charge Rod</em> was to stop playing the cards (like <strong>Heart of the Vault</strong> or <strong>Alluring Ember</strong>) that made the <strong>Power</strong> base so hard. This last version of the deck has a very good <strong>Power</strong> base, so hard casting your cards [ie: playing them from hand] is not a problem at all if you can survive</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>Shiftstoned: </strong><br />
          Still, the<strong> Influence Chart</strong> demonstrates that there is a lot of competition for hitting fairly demanding <strong>Influence</strong> requirements in the mid to late game. With only a moderate amount of additional card draw. What makes this possible?</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
          I do believe one of the most important cards in the deck is again <strong>Privilege of Rank</strong> because the deck is so <strong>Power</strong> hungry, and basically can&#39;t win if you don&#39;t hit six power on <strong>Turn 6</strong>.&nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          And to play that card, it was necessary to make the deck almost exclusively <strong>Rakano</strong> (FJ), and only splash the most necessary card from <strong>Time</strong> - <strong>Divining Rod</strong>.</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>Granite Waystone</strong> is also a particularly great <strong>Power</strong> card in this deck because not only can it be used for the <strong>Market</strong>, but it is also a real unit if you play <strong>Kaleb, Uncrowned Prince</strong>.</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
          The addition of <strong>Answer the Call</strong> has added weapons to the <em>Charge Rod</em> strategy of cheating out units, and pushed this deck into more mainstream success. Is it the 6JJ spell that holds it all together?&nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
          Yes, <strong>Answer the Call</strong> is the best card in the deck by a lot. You can win a game from an empty board with<strong> Answer the Call</strong>. Because you have like a 30% chance to hit Divining Rod and more than 75% to hit a Charge unit, so you make crazy stuff a lot of the time.</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
          You wrote at length about your thoughts on <em>Charge Rod</em> as part of your <a href="https://eternaltitans.com/camat0s-h0t-takes-7-31/" target="_blank">weekly metagame analysis</a> on the <strong>Eternal Titans</strong> website. In addition to thanking your team mate Grimfan for his role in the deck&rsquo;s evolution, you spoke frankly about your feelings towards so-called &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; decks (ie: decks that win with explosive or high-rolling combos) in <strong>Eternal</strong>.&nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          Do the cards exist now for more &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; decks that have yet to be discovered/refined? <strong>Dramatist&rsquo;s Mask </strong>for example...</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>camat0: </strong><br />
          I don&#39;t think <strong>Dramatist&rsquo;s Mask</strong> will see competitive play, because it is just to easy to interact with for the opponent.</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          But I do think the game is very friendly to unfair decks in general right now. <strong>Markets</strong> in particular made a lot of unfair decks possible with the consistency they add to the deck<br />
          <br />
          <h1g>Even higher voltage</h1g>Shiftstoned recently featured an article on a<a href="http://HighVoltage.html"> first-place Alessi deck</a> that included 39 Power Sources, which seemed pretty extreme at the time. Yet camat0&rsquo;s list contains no less than 41 <strong>Power</strong> Sources - well over half of the 75 cards in the deck. Are we seeing an escalating Power meta?</div>

            What makes Power so important in a deck that tops out at 4? (Or 6 if you include <strong>Sword of Unity&rsquo;s Spellcraft</strong>...)</div>

          <div>
            <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
            Turns out that playing <strong>Initiate of the Sands</strong> into <strong>Trail Maker</strong> into 3 more units, and playing <strong>Stand Together</strong> or <strong>Sword of Unity</strong> before <strong>Turn 5</strong> beats most slow decks. It is just too much pressure and they can&rsquo;t even answer it with <strong>Harsh Rule</strong>.</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            This deck is all about curving out into <strong>Stand Together</strong> or <strong>Sword of Unity</strong>. Once you do that, they lose because they are too far behind in the board and can&#39;t play a board clear. So the <strong>Power</strong> is really important to make sure you can accomplish that.</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>Shiftstoned: </strong><br />
            How would you characterize this deck? Aggressive? Midrange? Aggressive midrange? Something different?</div>

            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
            I will say this is a<strong> Midrange</strong> deck, but most of the time it plays like a hyper aggressive deck.<br />
            <br />
            And also you have the Plan B of using <strong>Ironfist Chancellor</strong> each turn if you stall. It is not that hard to protect him. And in particular if you ever play <strong>Sword of Unity</strong> on him, he becomes a nightmare for any deck.</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
            Did you consider including any&nbsp;<strong>Standards</strong> for the synergy with <strong>Alessi</strong>?</div>

            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
            I don&#39;t want <strong>Standards</strong> in this deck because it is all about curving out. The extra cards are way less important than having the board early and casting <strong>Stand Together</strong> on it.<br />

            Camat0&#39;s <em>TJP Hatebears</em> is a three-color build that prioritizes <strong>Time</strong> for early <strong>Teachers of Humility</strong> (TT) and <strong>Turn 6 Predatory Carnosaurs</strong> (TTT), with a little <strong>Svetya, Orene of Kosul</strong>&nbsp;(JP) in between.&nbsp;</div>

          <div>
            <strong>Shiftstoned: </strong><br />
            What were your thoughts when constructing the <strong>Power</strong> base for <em>TJP Hatebears</em>?</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>camato:</strong><br />
            To make a power base that can support <strong>Initiate of the Sands</strong> on <strong>Turn 1</strong>&nbsp; and <strong>Teacher of Humility</strong> on Turn 2, I needed to make a sacrifice and and only splash the other colors.&nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            As you can see I don&#39;t play [higher Influence] cards like <strong>Valkyrie Enforcer</strong> (JJ) or <strong>Hooru Pacifier</strong> (JJP). I would love to&nbsp; have them in the deck, but I just can&#39;t support them.&nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
            That brings up a great point that newer deck builders may be able to learn from. When building a three color <strong>Power</strong> base. you often want to prioritize cards in a certain color. So you are probably better off playing weaker cards (with lower <strong>Influence</strong>) in the other colors. Having more powerful (and more costly) cards doesn&rsquo;t help you if you can&rsquo;t reliably play them.</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>camat0: </strong><br />
            For sure. In general I say that people play less Power or fixing than they should.</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            Shiftstoned: Although you have one Crystallize in the Market, every other card in this deck is either Time or only has a single influence in any one color (including JP and TP). This allows you to hit your priority Influence requirements quite reliably. And all this without any additional card draw beyond Seek Power.&nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            camat0: The key in this Power base is Diplomatic Seal. It is this card that allows you to build 3 color Power bases for aggressive decks,&nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            Shiftstoned: It is also worth mentioning that you have a lot of Undepleted Power, or potentially Unedepleted Power in the form of Seats instead of Crests.&nbsp; This helps to ensure that your important units can be played on curve at every stage of the game. It is a very different approach from the FJS Control deck we were looking at earlier.</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            Camat0: Yes, as you say I only have 2 Crests, and the reason for that is to have most of my power Undepleted. With 2 Crests and 4 Seek Power, I will draw less than 2 of them in most of my hands - making the deck curve out most of the time.</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            Shiftstoned: What does the future hold for TJP Hatebears?</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            Camat0: This is a very powerful deck and I think it is good,&nbsp; but it is not great. I&#39;m not sure what is missing yet to make this deck great, but for sure I think it has a lot of potential.</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>

        Shiftstoned: What were your thoughts when constructing the Power base for TJP Hatebears?</div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        To make a power base that can support Initiate of the Sands on Turn 1&nbsp; and Teacher of Humility on Turn 2, I needed to make a sacrifice and and only splash the other colors.&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        As you can see I don&#39;t play [higher Influence] cards like Valkyrie Enforcer (JJ) or Hooru Pacifier (JJP). I would love to&nbsp; have them in the deck, but I just can&#39;t support them.&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        Shiftstoned: That brings up a great point that newer deck builders may be able to learn from. When building a three color Power base. you often want to prioritize cards in a certain color. So you are probably better off playing weaker cards (with lower influence) in the other colors. Having more powerful (and more costly) cards doesn&rsquo;t help you if you can&rsquo;t reliably play them.</div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        camat0: For sure. In general I say that people play less Power or fixing than they should.</div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        Shiftstoned: Although you have one Crystallize in the Market, every other card in this deck is either Time or only has a single influence in any one color (including JP and TP). This allows you to hit your priority Influence requirements quite reliably. And all this without any additional card draw beyond Seek Power.&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        camat0: The key in this Power base is Diplomatic Seal. It is this card that allows you to build 3 color Power bases for aggressive decks,&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        Shiftstoned: It is also worth mentioning that you have a lot of Undepleted Power, or potentially Unedepleted Power in the form of Seats instead of Crests.&nbsp; This helps to ensure that your important units can be played on curve at every stage of the game. It is a very different approach from the FJS Control deck we were looking at earlier.</div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        Camat0: Yes, as you say I only have 2 Crests, and the reason for that is to have most of my power Undepleted. With 2 Crests and 4 Seek Power, I will draw less than 2 of them in most of my hands - making the deck curve out most of the time.</div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        Shiftstoned: What does the future hold for TJP Hatebears?</div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        Camat0: This is a very powerful deck and I think it is good,&nbsp; but it is not great. I&#39;m not sure what is missing yet to make this deck great, but for sure I think it has a lot of potential.</div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        Shiftstoned: We are all looking forward to seeing what you come up with next camat0. Congratulations on your first place finish in the debut of Eternal Community League, and hope to have you back here again for more conversations on Shiftstoned.com.</div>
