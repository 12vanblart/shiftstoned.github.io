        <h0g>QUADROPHENIA:<br />
        Four decks, four Power bases, one winner</h0g> <subhead><strong>Camat0</strong> sits down with <strong>Shiftstoned</strong> to discuss the <strong>Power basese </strong>behind&nbsp;<br />
        all four of his winnning lists from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tgpeternal.com/tournaments/" target="_blank">Eternal Community League&#39;s</a><br />
        inaugural <a href="https://eternalwarcry.com/tournaments/details/kjeRWj2dzBs/ecl-sunday-challenge-swiss" target="_blank">Sunday Challenge</a> event.&nbsp;We talk&nbsp;<strong>Crests</strong>, fixing and the merits<br />
        of <strong>Privilege of Rank</strong>.</subhead><pg><strong>Camat0&nbsp;</strong>is a name familiar to anyone who follows competitive <strong>Eternal</strong>. The current reigning <a href="https://rngeternal.com/ets/">Eternal Tournament Series</a> <strong>World Champion</strong> and <strong>2018 All-Star</strong> is showing no signs of slowing down this year, as his recent first-place finish demonstrates.&nbsp;<strong>Shiftstoned</strong> caught up with him recently for an interview.&nbsp;</pg><h1g>Part I - The New Icaria Black</h1g><strong>Camat0&rsquo;s</strong> <em>Removal Pile</em>, updated for the <strong>Fall of Argenport</strong>. How has the <strong>Power</strong> base changed and what makes it even better now?</pg> <img alt="Influence Chart" src="images/FJSControl.jpeg" style="width: 840px; margin: 0px 70px 0px 105px;" title="Influence Chart" /> <pg><strong>Shiftstoned:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
        You chose this list for one of your four decks on Sunday as part of the event&#39;s Conquest format. But the origins of it stretch back a while...<br />
        <br />
        <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
        This is the first deck I built with the <strong>Fall of Argenport</strong>. In fact I built this deck the day after <strong>Fall of Argenport</strong> was legal, and it has changed very little from there.<br />
        <br />
        But this version of<strong> FJS</strong> is basically an updated version of <em>Removal Pile</em>, the deck I made to break the <strong>Tavrod</strong> meta back in early 2018.<br />
        <br />
        At that time, manuS and I finished first and second in the <strong>Eternal Tournament Series S#W#</strong> with that version of the deck, the first tournament we ever played it.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
        Since then, some things have changed in the way <strong>Power</strong> bases are built in <strong>Eternal</strong>. One of the major differences between this list and the previous versions appears to be the inclusion of all 12 available <strong>Crests</strong>.<br />
        <br />
        How do you think this has improved the deck? Has it changed the way you play <strong>FJS</strong> control?<br />
        <br />
        <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
        <strong>Crests</strong> changed the game at a fundamental level. They not only made every <strong>Control</strong> and <strong>Midrange</strong> deck more consistent, but they also allow <strong>Control</strong> decks to play more <strong>Power</strong> without flooding out.<br />
        <br />
        Now that we have all ten of the <strong>Crests</strong>, I think every <strong>Control</strong> deck that plays three colors should play at least one or two more <strong>Power</strong> cards than they used too. In the end I find more <strong>Power</strong> makes your deck work better in every way now.<br />
        <br />
        Also the existence of <strong>Crests</strong> makes it really hard to justify two color <strong>Control</strong> decks any more. You want the <strong>Crest</strong> even if they are off-color, and at that point splashing another color is just too easy.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Shiftstoned: </strong><br />
        It is also interesting to note that you added an extra copy of <strong>Privilege of Rank</strong> (a&nbsp; valuable discard target in addition to being a <strong>Power</strong> source), while at the same time removing <strong>Quarry</strong> (a powerful discard effect).<br />
        <br />
        <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
        People play <strong>Privilege of Rank</strong> only because it has synergy with <strong>Bulletshaper</strong> or other discard effects, when the truth is that the card is just good.<br />
        <br />
        I&#39;m happy to hard cast the card in a lot of decks, but most people don&#39;t and I think that is why it was so underplayed.<br />
        <h1g>Part II - The Boogeyman</h1g><strong>Camat0&rsquo;s</strong> <em>Call Me Maybe</em> is a complicated list with a <strong>Power</strong> base that has seen much refinement since its early origins as a <em>Charge Rod</em> deck.</pg><img alt="Influence Chart" src="images/CallMeMaybe.jpeg" style="width: 840px; margin: 0px 70px 0px 105px;" title="Influence Chart" /><br />
        <pg>[<span style="font-weight: bolder;">Edit:</span>&nbsp;As this article was being finalized, <strong>Dire Wolf Digital</strong> made <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/531640/announcements/detail/1692677521819338427" target="_blank">an announcement</a> that&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bolder;">Answer the Call&nbsp;</span>has been nerfed to 7JJ. While it remains to be seen what impact this will have on <strong>Eternal</strong>, the image above and conversations with camat0 have been preserved to reflect the state of the meta at the time of his first-place tournament finish with this deck].&nbsp;</pg><pg><strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
        For a while now, <strong>Divining Rod</strong> has allowed players to cheat out units that their <strong>Power</strong> base wouldn&rsquo;t normally support by playing them automatically from the deck rather than from hand. But it has remained something of a fringe strategy. What has changed?
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
          The key for <em>Charge Rod</em> was to stop playing the cards (like <strong>Heart of the Vault</strong> or <strong>Alluring Ember</strong>) that made the <strong>Power</strong> base so hard. This last version of the deck has a very good <strong>Power</strong> base, so hard casting your cards [ie: playing them from hand] is not a problem at all if you can survive</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>Shiftstoned: </strong><br />
          Still, the<strong> Influence Chart</strong> demonstrates that there is a lot of competition for hitting fairly demanding <strong>Influence</strong>&nbsp;requirements in the mid to late game. With only a moderate amount of additional card draw. What makes this possible?</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
          I do believe one of the most important cards in the deck is again <strong>Privilege of Rank</strong> because the deck is so <strong>Power</strong> hungry, and basically can&#39;t win if you don&#39;t hit six power on <strong>Turn 6 </strong>[for <strong>Answer the Call</strong>, now 7JJ].&nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          And to play that card, it was necessary to make the deck almost exclusively <strong>Rakano</strong> (FJ), and only splash the most necessary card from <strong>Time</strong> - <strong>Divining Rod</strong>.</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>G</strong><span style="font-weight: bolder;">ranite Waystone</span>&nbsp;is also a particularly great&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bolder;">Power</span>&nbsp;card in this deck. It gives you&nbsp; you a free card to exchange&nbsp; in the <strong>Market,</strong> and also this little 1/1 transforms into&nbsp; a real threat when you play&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bolder;">Kaleb, Uncrowned Prince</span>.<br />
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
          The addition of <strong>Answer the Call</strong> has added weapons to the <em>Charge Rod</em> strategy of cheating out units, and pushed this deck into more mainstream success. Is it the 6JJ spell [now 7JJ] that holds it all together?&nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
          Yes, <strong>Answer the Call</strong> is the best card in the deck by a lot. You can win a game from an empty board with<strong> Answer the Call</strong>. Because you have like a 30% chance to hit <strong>Divining Rod</strong> and more than 75% to hit a <strong>Charge</strong> unit, so you make crazy stuff a lot of the time.</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
          You wrote at length about your thoughts on <em>Charge Rod</em> as part of your <a href="https://eternaltitans.com/camat0s-h0t-takes-7-31/" target="_blank">weekly metagame analysis</a> on the <strong>Eternal Titans</strong> website. In addition to thanking your team mate Grimfan for his role in the deck&rsquo;s evolution, you spoke frankly about your feelings towards so-called &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; decks (ie: decks that win with explosive or high-rolling combos) in <strong>Eternal</strong>.&nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          Do the cards exist now for more unfair decks that have yet to be discovered or refined? <strong>Dramatist&rsquo;s Mask </strong>for example...</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>camat0: </strong><br />
          I don&#39;t think <strong>Dramatist&rsquo;s Mask</strong> will see competitive play, because it is just to easy to interact with for the opponent.</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          But I do think the game is very friendly to unfair decks in general right now. <strong>Markets</strong> in particular made a lot of unfair decks possible with the consistency they add to the deck<br />
          <br />
          <h1g>Part III - Even higher voltage</h1g>Shiftstoned recently featured an article on a<a href="http://HighVoltage.html"> first-place Alessi deck</a> that included 39 Power Sources, which seemed pretty extreme at the time. Yet camat0&rsquo;s list contains no less than 41 <strong>Power</strong> Sources - well over half of the 75 cards in the deck. Are we seeing an escalating <strong>Power</strong> meta?</div>
        <div>
          <br />
          <img alt="Influence Chart" src="images/AlessiCombrei.jpeg" style="width: 840px; margin: 0px 70px 0px -175px;" title="Influence Chart" /><br />
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
            What makes <strong>Power</strong> so important in a deck that tops out at 4? (Or 6 if you include <strong>Sword of Unity&rsquo;s Spellcraft</strong>...)</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
            Turns out that playing <strong>Initiate of the Sands</strong> into <strong>Trail Maker</strong> into 3 more units, and playing <strong>Stand Together</strong> or <strong>Sword of Unity</strong> before <strong>Turn 5</strong> beats most slow decks. It is just too much pressure and they can&rsquo;t even answer it with <strong>Harsh Rule </strong>[due to all the units with <strong>Aegis</strong>].</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            This deck is all about curving out into <strong>Stand Together</strong> or <strong>Sword of Unity</strong>. Once you do that, they lose because they are too far behind in the board and can&#39;t play a board clear. So the <strong>Power</strong> is really important to make sure you can accomplish that.</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>Shiftstoned: </strong><br />
            How would you characterize this deck? Aggressive? Midrange? Aggressive midrange? Something different?</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
            I will say this is a<strong> Midrange</strong> deck, but most of the time it plays like a hyper aggressive deck.<br />
            <br />
            And also you have the Plan B of using <strong>Ironfist Chancellor</strong> each turn if you stall. It is not that hard to protect him. And in particular if you ever play <strong>Sword of Unity</strong> on him, he becomes a nightmare for any deck.</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
            Did you consider including any&nbsp;<strong>Standards</strong> for the synergy with <strong>Alessi</strong>?</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
            I don&#39;t want <strong>Standards</strong> in this deck because it is all about curving out. The extra cards are way less important than having the board early and casting <strong>Stand Together</strong> on it.<br />
            <br />
            &nbsp;</div>

          <div>
            Camat0&#39;s <em>TJP Hatebears</em> is a three-color build that prioritizes <strong>Time</strong> for early <strong>Teachers of Humility</strong> (TT) and <strong>Turn 6 Predatory Carnosaurs</strong> (TTT), with a little <strong>Svetya, Orene of Kosul</strong>&nbsp;(JP) in between.&nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>

            <img alt="Influence Chart" src="images/TJPHatebears.jpeg" style="margin-right: 70px; margin-left: -205px; width: 840px;" title="Influence Chart" /></div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>Shiftstoned: </strong><br />
            What were your thoughts when constructing the <strong>Power</strong> base for <em>TJP Hatebears</em>?</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>camato:</strong><br />
            To make a power base that can support <strong>Initiate of the Sands</strong> on <strong>Turn 1</strong>&nbsp; and <strong>Teacher of Humility</strong> on Turn 2, I needed to make a sacrifice and and only splash the other colors.&nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            As you can see I don&#39;t play [higher Influence] cards like <strong>Valkyrie Enforcer</strong> (JJ) or <strong>Hooru Pacifier</strong> (JJP). I would love to&nbsp; have them in the deck, but I just can&#39;t support them.&nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
            That brings up a great point that newer deck builders may be able to learn from. When building a three color <strong>Power</strong> base. you often want to prioritize cards in a certain color. So you are probably better off playing weaker cards (with lower <strong>Influence</strong>) in the other colors. Having more powerful (and more costly) cards doesn&rsquo;t help you if you can&rsquo;t reliably play them.</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>camat0: </strong><br />
            For sure. In general I say that people play less <strong>Power</strong> or fixing [ie: <strong>Influence</strong> sources for secondary colors] than they should.</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
            Although you have one <strong>Crystallize</strong> in the Market, every other card in this deck is either <strong>Time</strong> or only has a single influence in any one color (including JP and TP).</div>
          <div>
            <br />
            This allows you to hit your priority <strong>Influence</strong> requirements quite reliably. And all this is accomplished without any additional card draw beyond <strong>Seek Power</strong>.&nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <br />
            <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
            The key in this <strong>Power</strong> base is <strong>Diplomatic Seal</strong>. It is this card that allows you to build three color <strong>Power</strong> bases for aggressive decks.&nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
            Right. <strong>Diplomatic Seal</strong> provides <strong>Undepleted Power</strong>, which is great to have as long as you are able to hit your Influence requirements.&nbsp; It is also worth mentioning that you have a lot more potential for&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Undepleted Power</strong>, in the form of <strong>Seats</strong> instead of <strong>Crests</strong>.&nbsp; This helps to ensure that your important units can be played on curve at every stage of the game. It is a very different approach from the <strong>FJS Control</strong> deck we were looking at earlier.</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>Camat0:</strong><br />
            Yes, as you say I only have 2 <strong>Crests</strong>, and the reason for that is to have most of my power <strong>Undepleted</strong>. With 2 <strong>Crests</strong> and 4 <strong>Seek Power</strong>, I will draw less than two of them in most of my hands - making the deck curve out most of the time.</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>Shiftstoned: </strong><br />
            What does the future hold for <strong>TJP Hatebears</strong>?</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
            This is a very powerful deck and I think it is good, but it is not great. I&#39;m not sure what is missing yet to make this deck great, but for sure I think it has a lot of potential.</div>
          <div>
            &nbsp;</div>
          <div>
            <strong>Shiftstoned: </strong><br />
            We are all looking forward to seeing what you come up with next camat0.<br />
