        the merits of <strong>Privilege of Rank</strong>.</subhead><pg><h2g><strong>camat0&nbsp;</strong>is a name familiar to anyone who follows competitive <strong>Eternal</strong>. The current reigning <a href="https://rngeternal.com/ets/">Eternal Tournament Series</a> <strong>World Champion</strong> and <strong>2018 All-Star</strong> is showing no signs of slowing down this year.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Shiftstoned</strong> caught up with him recently to disuss the results of his recent first-place finish at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/293451380" target="_blank">ECL&#39;s Sunday Challenge</a>, an event that uses a <a href="https://www.tgpeternal.com/tournament-rules" target="_blank">Conquest format</a> where each participant brings four decks to battle with.&nbsp;</h2g></pg><h1g>Part I - The New Icaria Black</h1g><h2g><strong>Camat0&rsquo;s</strong> <em>Removal Pile</em>, updated for the <strong>Fall of Argenport</strong>. How has the <strong>Power</strong> base changed and what makes it even better now?</h2g></pg> <img alt="Influence Chart" src="images/FJSControlChart.jpeg" style="width: 840px; margin: -40px 70px 0px 315px;" title="Influence Chart" /> <pg><iq><strong>Shiftstoned:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
        You chose this list for one of your four decks on Sunday as part of the event&#39;s Conquest format. But the origins of it stretch back a while...</iq><br />
        <br />
        <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
        This is the first deck I built with the <strong>Fall of Argenport</strong>. In fact I built this deck the day after <strong>Fall of Argenport</strong> was legal, and it has changed very little from there.<br />
        <br />
        But this version of<strong> FJS</strong> is basically an updated version of <em>Removal Pile</em>, the deck I made to break the <strong>Tavrod</strong> meta back in early 2018.<br />
        <br />
        At that time, manuS and I finished first and second in the <strong>Eternal Tournament Series </strong><a href="https://eternalwarcry.com/tournaments/details/YYwl2hhlUDs/ets-weekly-top-8" target="_blank">weekly swiss<strong>&nbsp;</strong>event</a> with that version of the deck, the first tournament we ever played it.<br />
        <br />
        <iq><strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
        Since then, some things have changed in the way <strong>Power</strong> bases are built in <strong>Eternal</strong>. One of the major differences between this list and the previous versions appears to be the inclusion of all 12 available <strong>Crests</strong>.<br />
        <br />
        How do you think this has improved the deck?&nbsp;</iq><br />
        <br />
        <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
        <strong>Crests</strong> changed the game at a fundamental level. They not only made every <strong>Control</strong> and <strong>Midrange</strong> deck more consistent, but they also allow <strong>Control</strong> decks to play more <strong>Power</strong> without flooding out.<br />
        <br />
        Now that we have all ten of the <strong>Crests</strong>, I think every <strong>Control</strong> deck that plays three colors should play at least one or two more <strong>Power</strong> cards than they used too. In the end, I find more <strong>Power</strong> makes your deck work better in every way now.<br />
        <br />
        Also the existence of <strong>Crests</strong> makes it really hard to justify two color <strong>Control</strong> decks any more. You want the <strong>Crest</strong> even if they are off-color, and at that point splashing another color is just too easy.<br />
        <br />
        <iq><strong>Shiftstoned: </strong><br />
        It looks like you also added an extra copy of <strong>Privilege of Rank</strong>, another <strong>Power</strong> source.... </iq><br />
        <br />
        <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
        Many people play <strong>Privilege of Rank</strong> only because it has synergy with <strong>Bulletshaper</strong> or other discard effects, when the truth is that the card is just good.<br />
        <br />
        I&#39;m happy to hard cast the card in a lot of decks, but most people don&#39;t and I think that is why it was so underplayed.<br />

        <img alt="Influence Chart" src="images/CallMeChart.jpeg" style="width: 840px; margin: -40px 70px 0px 315px; height: 589px;" title="Influence Chart" /> <pg>[<span style="font-weight: bolder;">Edit:</span>&nbsp;As this article was being finalized, <strong>Dire Wolf Digital</strong> <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/531640/announcements/detail/1692677521819338427" target="_blank">announced</a> that&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bolder;">Answer the Call&nbsp;</span>has been nerfed to 7JJ. While it remains to be seen what impact this will have on <strong>Eternal</strong>, the image above and conversations with camat0 have been preserved to reflect the state of the meta at the time of his first-place tournament finish with this deck.]&nbsp;</pg><pg><iq><strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
        For a while now, <strong>Divining Rod</strong> has allowed players to cheat out units that their <strong>Power</strong> base wouldn&rsquo;t normally support by playing them automatically from the deck rather than from hand. But it has remained something of a fringe strategy. What has changed?</iq><br />
        <br />
        <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
        The key for <em>Charge Rod</em> was to stop playing the cards (like <strong>Heart of the Vault</strong> or <strong>Alluring Ember</strong>) that made the <strong>Power</strong> base so hard. This last version of the deck has a very good <strong>Power</strong> base, so hard casting your cards [ie: playing them from hand] is not a problem at all if you can survive.<br />
        <br />
        <div>
          <iq><strong>Shiftstoned: </strong><br />
          Still, the<strong> Influence Chart</strong> demonstrates that there is a lot of competition for hitting fairly demanding <strong>Influence</strong>&nbsp;requirements in the mid to late game. With only a moderate amount of additional card draw. What makes this possible?</iq></div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
          I do believe one of the most important cards in the deck is again <strong>Privilege of Rank</strong> because the deck is so <strong>Power</strong> hungry, and basically can&#39;t win if you don&#39;t hit six power on <strong>Turn 6 </strong>[for <strong>Answer the Call</strong>].&nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          And to play that card, it was necessary to make the deck almost exclusively <strong>Rakano</strong> (FJ), and only splash the most necessary card from <strong>Time</strong> - <strong>Divining Rod</strong>.</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          I also play&nbsp;<strong>Diogo M&aacute;laga</strong> because it is not that hard to make it playable once we already play <strong>Divining Rod</strong> and he is very important for the early game of the deck.</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>Granite Waystone</strong>&nbsp;is also a particularly great&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bolder;">Power</span>&nbsp;card in this deck. It gives you&nbsp; you a free card to exchange&nbsp; in the <strong>Market,</strong> and also this little 1/1 transforms into&nbsp; a real threat when you play&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bolder;">Kaleb, Uncrowned Prince</span>.<br />
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <iq><strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
          The addition of <strong>Answer the Call</strong> has added weapons to the <em>Charge Rod</em> strategy of cheating out units, and pushed this deck into more mainstream success. Is it the 6JJ spell [now 7JJ] that holds it all together?&nbsp;</iq></div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <strong>camat0:</strong><br />
          Yes, <strong>Answer the Call</strong> is the best card in the deck by a lot. You can win a game from an empty board with<strong> Answer the Call</strong>. Because you have like a 30% chance to hit <strong>Divining Rod</strong> and more than 75% to hit a <strong>Charge</strong> unit, so you make crazy stuff a lot of the time.</div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;</div>
