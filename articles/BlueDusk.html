        		 <ats>
		  		Introductory sentence or two will go here. We said two, so this would be the second sentence. Actually a third sentence might be required and that could go here.
			</ats>

Success for <strong>Team SPG</strong> continues. Since we last spoke, <strong>SecondBlue</strong> topped the first-ever <a href="">ECL invitational event</a>, with <strong>BruisedByGod</strong> taking third place. In the same weekend, <strong>SooNo</strong> placed in the Season Three finals of the <a href="">Eternal Tournament Series</a>, second only to 2017 World Champion <strong>camat0</strong>.
<br /><br />
In this second part of a <a href="Seekers1.html">series</a>,  we are joined by <strong>Tonygeeeee</strong>: <strong>SPG</strong> Eternal administrator, co-host of the <strong>SPG</strong> podcast, and ETS veteran in his own right.

				Do you have a favorite collaborative deck-building story?
			</iq>
			<br /><br />

	        <strong>Tonygeeeee:</strong><br />
			Soono made an Armory list right as he joined SPG. I told him his version was trash. I then apologized and tried the deck. It was pure gas and I’m forever grateful God gave me Soono.
			<br /> <br />

	        <strong>SooNo:</strong><br />
			I dont have just one story. It's been enjoyful every time we sit down to finalize or brew from &ldquo;scratch&rdquo;. I get in a voice call, then listen to these absolute mad men talk about bad cards and worse ideas like &ldquo;<strong>Nostrix</strong> is god tier.&rdquo; 
			<br /> <br />
			<strong>BruisedByGod</strong> will say &ldquo;Dude, <strong>Suffocate</strong> is really really good.&rdquo; Or <strong>Tonygeeeee</strong>, &ldquo;What are you on about? Lethrai draftstarter (<strong>Duskstalker</strong>) is insane.&rdquo; 
			<br /> <br />
			Then <strong>SecondBlue</strong>, &ldquo;Call me crazy, but <strong>End of the Barrel</strong> seems really good." And <strong>Paradox</strong>, &ldquo;Dude who needs <strong>Obliterate</strong> when you have Infernus?&rdquo; 
			<br /> <br />
			Now <strong>Drolicheck<strong>, &ldquo;So guys, I havent played all week. I don't know what is good. But <strong>SecondBlue's</strong> list seemed fun. So I'm just going to run with it.&rdquo; Finally <strong>childroland</strong> &ldquo;Who won today?&rdquo; Answer: <strong>childroland</strong>, duh. 
			<br /> <br />			
			This list goes on and on. But the best part about all this madness is we win hahaha.
			<br /> <br />

				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
				What is it like to face your teammates in a competitive event?
			</iq>
			<br /> <br />

	        <strong>Tonygeeeee:</strong><br />
			 I’m 0-6 vs Secondblue and like 2-15 overall since the S2 invitational vs my teammates. I hate it. Even when you win it feels bad, but for me, winning isn’t a possibility anyway :P Once, I was playing vs Bradykin (Chalice vs Armory) and he missed lethal, so I just joined his voicechannel and i just called him out. 
			<br /> <br />

	        <strong>SooNo:</strong><br />
			 I ask for nothing more then to face the best players on good decks. Its the only true way to test your skill and get better at anything you do. Plus its A LOT OF FREE WINS!!ahahaha
			<br /> <br />

	        <iq>
				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
				What are your thoughts about representing team SPG in the upcoming invitational?
				</iq>
			<br /> <br />

	        <strong>Tonygeeeee:</strong><br />
			We’ve had a SPG member win the whole thing twice now, so we have pressure to continue on our streak. (I did my part tho, so I don’t care :P) The goal right now is just to be better than ET and we’ve been doing a preeeeeetttttyyy good job with that
			<br /> <br />

	        <strong>SooNo:</strong><br />
			 In this upcoming invi for rngeternal.com, well im sorry to spg but you all know i have no chance. I get humiliated and Well call it even while we blame bbg for asking me to join in the first place.
			<br /> <br />

	        <iq>
				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
			What reactions have you received from the Eternal community on Team SPG’s recent success?
			</iq>
			<br /> <br />

	        <strong>Tonygeeeee:</strong><br />
			 I think most people from the community don’t care about team affiliations, but when we see people chant our names in Twitch Chat, it always feels good!
			<br /> <br />

	        <strong>SooNo:</strong><br />
			I dont get "reactions" people are either not to fond of me or know im a scrooge and better off not talking too me hahahaha
			<br /> <br />

	        <iq>
				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
				You must be proud of your teammates. What has it been like to watch the SPG organization grow and flourish?
			</iq>
			<br /> <br />

	        <strong>Tonygeeeee:</strong><br />
			When I first joined, Childroland just won an invitational and the team as a whole was doing great. I feel like a grew a lot as a player just talking to players like Roland, Hithar and Paradox. We don’t do a whole lot of content creation besides the SPG Podcast and streams, but I think most people recognises the SPG players as being some of the best players in the world. It’s been very humbling to be part of this group for a little bit more than a year. What I hate tho is that now I’m considered a trash player within this organisation… Maybe I should form my team with newer players so I can feel good about myself….
			<br /> <br />

	        <iq>
				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
			What goals do you have for SPG going forward?
			</iq>
			<br /> <br />

	        <strong>Tonygeeeee:</strong><br />
			We always talk about creating more content, but we’re mainly focused on competitive play. If DWD ever establish a competitive scene, you can rest assured we’ll be there, thriving for the top spot.
			<br /> <br />

	        <iq>
				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
				It looks like each of your teammates brought versions of at least one similar deck to the ECL invitational (Praxis Tokens), plus BBG and SooNo brought versions of Alessi: What contributed to both the individual and group decisions about which decks to bring?
			</iq>
			<br /> <br />

	        <strong>SooNo:</strong><br />
			After my zero merchants to camat0s about 6 merchants in the finals the night before bbg and i were going over options on what we want to play. He FINALLY agreed to play combrei for me and i had to play his bad valkryie deck both out of respect really we then asked eachother what uninteractive, mindless aggro deck can we jam and not feel bad? Ah praxis tokens, after we got our 3 we wanted to have a deck with a card we each "enjoy" or for me "hate least" his was the ugly buzzard nostrix and mine was the glorious amazing unstoppable perfect moment of creation. We looked over the lists and reged em up.
			<br /> <br />

	        <iq>
				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
			How is it different to prepare for a conquest format (four decks) compared to a single deck event format?
			</iq>
			<br /> <br />

	        <strong>SooNo:</strong><br />
			Honest conquest is nonsense. There are many things i dislike about it. Having 4 decks to play and all that jazz seems "cool" but its all a waste and unnecessary.
			<br /> <br />

	        <iq>
				<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
			Do the cash prizes provide extra motivation? Were TGP prizes awarded in your local currency or Soylent Meal Replacement Products?
			</iq>
			<br /> <br />

	        <strong>SooNo:</strong><br />
			Cash prizes are always great. But winning is the most important part.
