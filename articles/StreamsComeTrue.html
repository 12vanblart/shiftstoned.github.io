		  		Just hours before the first-ever <a href="https://rngeternal.com/2019-community-championship/" target="_blank">community qualifying event</a> for the <a href="https://www.direwolfdigital.com/news/eternal-world-championship-2019/">Eternal World Championships</a>, <strong>Grimfan</strong> tweeted out: “I've decided I'd like to stream more than I want to win.” 

<br /><br />In the end he did both, takng first place at the <a href="https://eternalwarcry.com/tournaments/details/_A5D5llwONM/ets-2018-s4w1-top-8" target="_blank">Eternal Tournament Series Season 4 Week 1</a> event with <em>ET Combrei Aggro</em> and doing it all on camera.

                As the first ever qualifying event for the official <a href="" target="_blank">Eternal World Championships</a>, the stakes were high for Week 1 of the <a href="" target="_blank">Eternal Tournament Series</a> fourth and final season of 2018. 
			<br /><br />
                Watching you finish in first place from the perspective of your own channel on <a href="" target="_blank">twitch</a> made it all the more exciting. What was it like for you to be streaming and playing in the event at the same time?
			</iq>
			<br /><br />
    
	        <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
            <!-- I’m familiar with playing in competitive events and also streaming them, so it wasn’t really an issue. --> In the past I felt like some of the issues I've had winning are due to wanting to stream my tournament matches all the time. You're at a bit of a disadvantage when you stream and play Eternal. It's a lot easier to play when you don't have to pay attention to the stream. I had made a decision, or so I thought anyway, that I wouldn't stream any more competitive events. I went back on that because I really like the community that comes and watches me play.
			<br /><br />
            <!-- I ended up streaming with a five minute delay which is what really made it hard. My stream’s very focused on chat interaction, so you may have caught me panic typing to the stream while also talking out loud the same thing I was typing, just to get around the delay a bit.	-->

            <!-- Distractions do not help, but there's always a fear that your opponent is watching and trying to gain some advantage. Even with a five minute delay, it often doesn't feel long enough. Because you might not use a card in a long game until the turn you're ready to win, so your opponent could have a large advantage. -->

            <!-- Really my thoughts on no longer streaming competitive Eternal came from the team tournament, and how it sort of brought out the worst of us. Some of that partially was from the fact that I was streaming it. And at one point RNG made a ruling based on the fact that now both parties had perfect information on both hands (which was not the case)

Honestly I've never cared much if my opponent knows the content of my hands, but now that the stakes are a bit higher I probably need to care more.

, but I am not sure that the multitasking is too much of an issue at this point            

Streaming with a delay is almost as bad as not streaming to be honest. It was difficult for me to do that. I know a couple other prominent streamers decided to go at it with no delay, and I think both of them were a bit sad when they hosted me haha            

From that team tournament 
-->
            <iq>	
			     <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
            It is easy to see how streaming and playing at the same time might introduce some complications. But you also seem almost compelled to do it anyway. Are there any upsides that maybe help to balance that out the negatives?</iq>
            <br /> <br />
                
	        <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
Well I will say that having chat interaction helps me a lot. Not for advice really, but because it helps me maintain some focus. I have some problems keeping focus in games. And even though chat is a distraction sometimes, they can also keep me on goal. I do really want to play my best when I'm playing in front of people. <!-- Now if mouche is in my chat, I often get some good advice hahaha. -->     
            <br /> <br />

            <iq>	
			     <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
Most of your teammates also brought the same list that eventually carried you to first place. What factors contributed to the decision to bring ET Combrei Aggro to the event?             </iq>
			<br /><br />

	        <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
I wanted a deck that could beat Temporal Control and also other Aggro decks that were not Combrei based. I did a lot of testing with it in the days leading up to the tournament and found it had a decent win rate against both of those strategies. I knew that it didn’t do well against midrange Time decks. But because of the surge of Temporal Control, I did not think we would see many of those.            <br /> <br />

            <iq>	
			     <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
How did the deck evolve over time?</iq>
			<br /><br />
            
	        <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
            <a href="" target="_blank">Camat0</a> is the person who came up with the base idea of playing Genetrix. In the few days leading up to the event, he had posted the list in our team chat. It had <strong>Sandstorm Titan</strong>, <strong>Auralian Merchant</strong>, and was running 27 power. I’ve always hated Combrei Aggro as a deck type. But with the addition of <strong>Genetrix Irel IV</strong> it reminded me a little of Rakano in a way. 
			<br /><br />
            Every time I've played Combrei Aggro, the deck felt ok but didn't seem to be able to beat mid-range time decks which happens to be a very large percentage of what you end up facing. For some reason because it's an Aggro deck that lacks reach, I tend to not do well with it. But I think this deck hit a good spot in the metagame and <strong>Genetrix</strong> gives you a feeling of reach.
     <br /> <br />            

            <iq>	
			     <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
Were any changes made to the Power base along the way?</iq>
			<br /><br />                      
            After <a href="" target="_blank">ManuS</a> had played it a bit, he took the Merchants out and brought the Power base up to 28. After the Merchants were gone, I decided to do some testing with it on stream. And while it didn’t overperform, the deck seemed good enough. And I knew I could tweak it to beat Temporal Control. 
			<br /><br />
            Because ManuS had posted about Temporal Control not too long ago, and it had been played quite a bit recently in ECL’s Sunday series, I figured I would need to be able to beat that deck. I spoke to ManuS about it, and I really wanted to replace the Sandstorm Titans with another Aegis threat. It came down to Sheriff Marley versus Copperhall Elite. And I found that Genetrix and lots of pump spells go well with the overwhelm that Elite has.
			<br /><br />
            Finally, after a lot of consideration I wanted to go up to 30 Power. And it wasn’t a difficult decision to make, since the Power I added was two more <strong>Crownwatch Tactics</strong>. To fit the Power in, I ended up taking out a <strong>Vanquish</strong> and a <strong>Stand Together</strong>. Once again this tweak is better against Temporal, but a lot worse against Mid-range Time decks.
            
We don't have merchants. So the theory was that we couldn't get rid of <strong>Vanquish</strong> in our bad matchups. So I decided to play one less. And adding the (Aegis unit) <strong>Copperhall Elite</strong> instead of <strong>Sandstorm Titan</strong> made me feel confident that I could go down to only two copies of <strong>Stand Together</strong>. 

            <!--            <iq>	
			     <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
Can you describe the origins of the deck?            </iq>
			<br /><br />

	        <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
Camat0, ManuS, and I worked on the deck together. Camat0 is the person who came up with the base idea of playing Genetrix. Manu took merchants out of camat0’s list. And I added the two extra Crownwatch Tactics to make the power base 30 power. I ended up cutting a Vanquish and a Stand Together.
			<br /><br /> -->

            <br /> <br />

            <iq>	
			     <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
There appears to be a nearly even split between Time and Justice Power sources. And the odds of drawing enough Influence to play your cards on curve are quite high for the most part. The minor exception being TT for <strong>Teacher of Humility</strong> on Turn 2, which is just slightly lower that what we're normally used to seeing in deck built by the Eternal Titans.
            </iq>
			<br /><br />

	        <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
Getting double Time on turn 2 was tough. And the Power base isn't perfect. But I felt that Temple Tactic was so much worse that I didn’t want to change them over. We considered Sheriff Marley in the four slot, but she didn’t do what I wanted her to do. Shifting over to <strong>Copperhall Elite</strong> made the sigil base a lot better. Having a four-drop you can cast without double J was really tempting for me. I kept getting to 4 [Maximum Power] without double J somehow, and Genetrix would sit stranded in my hand. Having a card I could naturally cast at 4 Power that had Aegis felt a lot better. Plus you want to lead with the Copperhall Elites anyway [in order to take advantage of Genetrix Summon effect].
            <br /> <br />
            
            <iq>	
			     <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
Genetrix seems to be a key card for this deck's winning strategy, and is a somewhat surprising choice. What led to her inclusion?            </iq>
			<br /><br />

	        <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
I’m not sure what led Camat0 to try out Genetrix. But she did get a lot better with Sword of Unity in the field. And the fact that most Shadow based decks run Annihilate as their premium removal. She is a bit vulnerable, but overall her upside is pretty amazing. I think the +1 power she provides is a really big deal for the deck. Going from 4-6 is almost as important as the +4/+4 she provides.
            <br /> <br />

<!-- I don’t know about future promos, but right now we have Arcanum Monitor, Dizo, Cabal Chairman, Tesya, Omen Shaper, Svetya, Orene of Kosul, Bloodscent Avisaur, and Wyatt, Junk Collector all in a good position to be in a higher tier deck. I think the others just need some more time to be built around, or some more cards to be released to make them better. 
            <br /> <br />
-->
            <iq>	
			     <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
What lies ahead for this list? Will you and your teammates continue to play and refine it?            </iq>
			<br /><br />

	        <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
I think some of the team is interested in refining it. I know that some consider Sheriff Marley better. And that because the Sword of Unity has overwhelm already you don’t really need overwhelm on the Copperhall Elite. I’m not sure that is true. I think if I were to bring it again to a tournament I’d look at something closer to a mix of mine and Tobboo’s lists. The merchants add a lot in a tournament setting. Flexibility. More access to Stand Together. And they give you a pretty big edge in the mirror.

You streamed every second of your winning run for hundreds(?) of fans on twitch. Seeing the games from your perspective and getting to hear your thought process as you played felt like a very different way for spectators to enjoay a competitive Eternal event. What were some of your initial trepidations about streaming the tournament?
            </iq>
			<br /><br />
                                    
	        <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
I have streamed tournaments before, and without a delay. I figured if an opponent wants to see my hand then it’s not too big of a deal. That was before the ETS fed into a tournament for an invite to the World Championships and now things are a little more serious. I wanted to make sure I could focus and give myself the best opportunity to win. In the end though I decided I wanted to stream the process because I love it so much, and decided to go with a 5 minute delay            <br /> <br />

<!--            <iq>	
			     <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
The S4W1 event was preceded by the ETS team league event in which you and your teammates took second place. Rather than featuring casters, that event was streamed with audio featuring a voice dialog among team players. How did the two experiences compare?
            </iq>
			<br /><br />

	        <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
I did go back and watch their coverage, I think it was interesting but probably not the best. The teams tend to get a bit heated and say things that they regret, and unless you have a good moderator on that it definitely makes the community look a little worse. I think that’s what the organizers of that particular tournament have in mind though, heated team versus team action.
            <br /> <br /> -->

			     <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
You've have a lot of experience streaming Eternal that some newer players may not be aware of, largely due to your hiatus. Can you describe the early history of your channel for those who are unfamliar?</iq>
			<br /><br />

                <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
I started streaming when Eternal lifted their NDA, and I think that was in the fall of 2016. I had always wanted to stream but could never find the confidence to do so. And Eternal finally made me do it after I enjoyed closed beta so much.           
            <br /> <br />
I worked at a computer lab as a supervisor and had a lot of free time. So my boss didn't mind me streaming from work as long as I helped students. I used to stream from work using text to speech. It was just an idea I came up with. 
            <br /> <br />
                
            <iq>	
			     <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
So you would appear on camera, but the commentary was a robotic computer voice generated by the words you typed?</iq>
			<br /><br />
                
Yeah. A lot of people actually thought I was mute. I ended up having to create a Nightbot command to explain I could talk - but just couldn't talk at work hahaha. 
			<br /><br />
                We had chat drafts back then too. I made a bot in Python that would pick the cards voted on by viewers. And then I'd play their decks. One season I took them to master on just chat drafts, it took us to about 11 I think? It was a lot of fun.
			<br /><br />

            <iq>	
			     <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
That is hilarious. And sort of suprising, because now your channel involves a lot of verbal responses to viewers. It feels very genuine.</iq>
			<br /><br />

            <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
Yeah, when people ask me something or talk to me in chat I'm instantly on it or ready to reply. It has been more difficult with more people in recent days, but in general I feel like I interact a ton.
			<br /><br />
When I first started streaming I thought about creating an act, and being the Larry the Cable Guy of streamers. But I decided I could never really be that good at acting. So I just figured I'd be myself and see how that went. 
			<br /><br />
I know that chat sometimes likes to go back to the old days, and wishes I would put on the text to speech robotic voice. But I hated it to be honest. It always held me back a great deal. I know some people like it but it takes a lot away from the stream for most.
			<br /><br />
                
            <iq>	
			     <strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
In addition to being a very unique presentation - the effort of streaming from work with an artificial voice just demonstrates it is something you must feel very motivated to do.</iq>
			<br /><br />

            <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
I have this bad habit of trying to get everything I want. For instance in the last ETS invitational, I was told I couldn't stream. So I ended up creating a new account and streaming a new player experience on my channel, while at the same time playing in the tournament (offstream) on another computer.
<br /><br />
I ended up not doing well in the invitational (more because I didn't test for the multi-deck format). But it was still fun. 
People seemed ok with what I was doing. <!-- But waystone was still pretty buggy and showing my hand off randomly. It was a chore to figure that out.--> I did comment on the tournament a little, but I tried to keep it mostly focused on the new player stuff because I didn't want to get in trouble.
<br /><br />

<iq>	
<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
That is some serious dedication. You have described on stream your efforts to apply for twitch partner and the subsequent rejection. But surely this is something you will continue to strive for? 
<br /><br /></iq>

            <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
I applied for partner before, and was denied back then as well. So I think this was actually my second time applying for partner.
I’ve decided to just keep going. I’ll apply again in October. Back in May I ended up quitting my job to go back to school, and I decided to give full time streaming another shot in August. I’m glad I did. 
<br /><br />                
                Every bit of promotion and advertising for Eternal is great. And I think that it has managed to acquire us a lot of new players. I’m very excited about the future of Eternal Card Game.

<br /><br />My average viewership has continued to climb. <!-- and I have no doubt I’ll be able to make it then. --> And my stream really took off in August. <!-- they just needed more time to get more numbers on my stream. -->
My average viewers now are around 130 or so, and I have a rather high host percentage. <!-- percentage so I do not know if Twitch will approve my application here in a week or two or not. -->    
<br /><br />    
<iq>	
<strong>Shiftstoned:</strong><br />
    You must have attracted a lot of new viewers when your channel was hosted by [popular card game streamer] TrumpSC following his highly-publicized Eternal stream.                   </iq>
			<br /><br />
                                
            <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
Yeah. I imagine that helped a lot. I had no idea Trump was going to host me. I think maybe a few people in his chat suggested it. I have a couple of very vocal people that watch me who really want me to succeed. He called me a "Happy little guy." And then hosted me up. 			<br /><br />
Luckily that part was not planned by DWD, because if it had been then I think someone else would have been the one to get the host.

 <!-- Yep I did. I had a fresh account that I had beat the tutorial on, and I linked it with another twitch prime account to get the rewards, and did what you do in the first few games (basically DWD tells you to play a draft and a gauntlet) and then we played in the event a bunch and I showed people how to build some decent budget decks from their prime packs -->

<br /><br />

            
<!-- The multi-deck format really threw me for a loop though, and I think that even though we had the winning deck trio, I didn't have enough experience with it to do well. Probably, I know that chat sometimes likes to go back to the old days and wishes I would put on the TTS, but I hated it to be honest.
The Text to speech always held me back a great deal, I know some people like it but it takes a lot away from the stream for most.

When not in front of the camera on your own channel, you can be found behind the scenes as a producer and caster for the ECL. These almost daily efforts require a lot of time and dedication. What motivates you to participate as often as you do?

I want to make it a career. I don't know how that will go in the end but it's something I'd like to do. I'd really like to make a living from this at some point, even if it's from playing Eternal competitively or just hanging out with my friends. So the dedication is in making that a reality. I hope anyway. I've met a lot of really great people in this community and I like being there for them.

    That would be cool. Our last ferret, Kitty, is getting pretty old but I did have her on the stream a few weeks ago. I am sure she will make another appearance at some point though.

I had quit the new job in may 2018, and took a couple months to figure out what I wanted to do. I cannot really tell you how many hours I have, but I know it was 8 hours a day 5 days a week for nearly a year. My viewers ranged from 25-50, at one point when streaming Eternal was brand new I was up in the 150's, but then some other streamers came along.
Basically my most shared audiences were with Truedawn, SirRhino, JonahVeil, and MannundMouse
when Mann came along I probably streamed a little less because I liked watching him more than streaming myself. I applied for partner around when SirRhino did, and was denied back then as well, so I think this is actually my second time applying for partner.
Now my average viewers are around 130 or so, but I have a rather high host percentage so I do not know if Twitch will approve my application here in a week or two or not.

            I am not sure I can really describe it all that well. I guess I'm just really happy to hang out with friends. I've met a lot of really great people in this community and I like being there for them. Sometimes I think about streaming other games but I just want to make sure I get to see my Eternal friends so I decide not to. As far as motivation goes, I'd really like to make a living from this at some point, even if it's from playing Eternal competitively or just hanging out with my friends. So the dedication is in making that a reality. I hope anyway

When not in front of the camera on your own channel, you can be found behind the scenes as a producer and caster for the ECL. These almost daily efforts require a lot of time and dedication. What motivates you to participate as often as you do?

I may have to actually stop participating as much as I have. Originally I had decided that the last season of ETS was going to be my last. Then the announcement of a World Championship invite for doing well in the ETS tournaments happened and I decided to just try and do it all. I had always wanted to try casting so I applied to the ECL for that. It turns out a lot of people want to cast and so really what they needed was producers. I figured when they had invited me I would only be casting, but an emergency came up and I decided to give producing a shot. My PC can barely handle it though so I am not sure how much I will be able to produce in the future.

Eternal has seen a lot of twitch initiatives in the past two months: the Collector’s Bounty package for Twitch Prime members. An innovative interactive drops program. And high-profile streams hosted by well-known players. How have these events influenced your channel? How have they influenced the game in general?

<!-- You may not know this but I have been streaming Eternal since it was allowed. I believe that was in the fall of 2016.  Suffice to say I remained very small but I had a good time. Recently in the past month, with all of these incentives for streamers I have really begun to take it seriously. Back in May I ended up quitting my job to go back to school, and I decided to give full time streaming another shot in August. I’m glad I did. Every bit of promotion and advertising they do is great, and I think that it has managed to acquire us a lot of new players. I’m very excited about the future of Eternal Card Game.

The announcement of Organized Play is definitely one of the most exciting things to happen in Eternal for quite a while. But there are still some questions about how it will play out in the months to come. Do you have any hopes for the way things will be handled? What are your aspirations both personally and for the Eternal Titans?

            </iq>

	        <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
I hope that things are handled well. I think I have an idea on how they are going to go and I think that we’ll all end up fine in the end. Direwolf Digital has definitely put a lot of money forward into competitive play and I’m really excited to see how it turns out. I have very high hopes for Eternal Titans, and I think that we’ll have more than one person in the World Championships for sure.            <br /> <br />

You have described on stream your efforts to apply for twitch partner and the subsequent rejection. Clearly this is something you will continue to strive for. What actions have you been taking to make this dream come true?

I’ve decided to just keep going. I’ll apply again in October. My average viewership has continued to climb and I have no doubt I’ll be able to make it then. Because my stream only really took off in August, they just needed more time to get more numbers on my stream.

What else lies ahead for Grimfan in all of your many various roles as a member of the Eternal community?

	        <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
I definitely will continue playing in tournaments. I’ve tried to produce content for my team’s website (eternaltitans.com) and I’ll probably have a tournament report up fairly soon about this past weekend. Other than that I’ll just keep playing Eternal live and hanging out. I don’t have any big plans right now.

Will any of your ferrets ever make a live appearance on camera?
            </iq>

	        <strong>Grimfan:</strong><br />
Well, our last ferret, Kitty, is getting pretty old but I did have her on the stream a few weeks ago. Unfortunately our other ferrets have passed away. I am sure she will make another appearance at some point though.
