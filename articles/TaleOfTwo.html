        <h0g>A Tale of Two Power Bases</h0g> <subhead>Two distinct archetypes prevailed at recent Eternal competitive events:<br />
        <br />
        Tobboo took first place at <a href="https://rngeternal.com/ets/" target="_blank">RNG&#39;s Eternal Tournament Series S3W3</a> with<br />
        <a href="https://eternalwarcry.com/decks/details/tLZBtn42Nyk/rakano-valkyries" target="_blank">Rakano Vaklyries</a>, a suprisingly <em>midrange</em>&nbsp;Fire/Justice list.<br />
        <br />
        Isochron topped <a href="https://www.tgpeternal.com/tournaments/" target="_blank">TGP&#39;s Casual Friday</a>&nbsp;with a fresh take on XPS control<br />
        dubbed <a href="https://eternalwarcry.com/decks/details/xoFIKwEh07I/adapted-green-feln" target="_blank">Adapted Feln Green</a>.<br />
        <br />
        Let&#39;s take a look at their power bases using the <a href="../epc/" target="_blank">Eternal Power Calculator</a>:</subhead><br />
        <br />
        <subhead><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: &quot;Open Sans Condensed Bold&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;, &quot;DejaVu Sans Mono&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Vera Sans Mono&quot;, monospace; font-size: 30px;">Rakano Valkyries</span><br />

        <br />
        Although <strong>Icaria the LIberator</strong> is in <strong>Rakano</strong> colors, she most has typically been played as a build-around finisher in 3 color Control decks that splash&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><img alt="Time" src="../epc/icon-primal.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" />&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em><img alt="Justice" src="../epc/icon-shadow.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" />&nbsp;</em>to comensate for&nbsp;.<br />
        <br />
        From a lore perspective, a pure and proactive&nbsp;<img alt="FIre" src="../epc/icon-fire.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" /><img alt="Justice" src="../epc/icon-justice.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" />deck would seem the most appropriate for the Rebel Valkyrie. But a third color has typically been seen as necessary to compensate for Rakano&rsquo;s more aggressive slant vs the burden of relying on a 7-cost headliner with double-triple influence cost.<em><img alt="Time" src="../epc/icon-primal.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" /></em><em><img alt="Time" src="../epc/icon-primal.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" /></em></pg><pg><br />
        While Rakano has been more typically associated with aggressive lists that get the job done with warcry and weapons. That has changed with a couple of new Power Base tools introduced with the Fall of Argenport, carving out a midranged niche for 2F Rakano decks to convincingly occupy.<br />
        <br />
        Speculation of course we knew about the first one Crest of Glory. But Bulletshaper has unexpectedly made Icaria more playable. While including Rakano Stranger to help with the influence costs may not have been unheard of, Bulletshaper has a lot more to offer.&nbsp;<h1g><img alt="Influence Chart" id="outmatched-powerbase" src="images/RakValkChartBulletShaper.jpeg" style="width: 842px; height: 383px;" title="Influence Chart" /></h1g> </pg> <img align="left" alt="Initiate of the Sands" src="Initiate_of_the_Sands.png" style="padding: 25px 15px; float: left; width: 297px;" title="Initiate of the Sands" /><pg><h1g>Adapted Green Feln</h1g>30: 18J, 21P, 17S, seek<br />
        <br />
        While Tobbo&rsquo;s Rakano Valkyries might showcase a new midrange archetype for a faction pair typically associated with more aggressive decks, Isochron&rsquo;s Adapted Green Feln presents a fresh take on a classic Control-oriented approach.<br />
        <br />
        What stands out on the Influence Chart are percentages dipping to 64 for PPP, and 59 for PPPP. Numbers this low would be very inadvisable in nearly any aggressive or midrange deck, but a control build like this one can afford it thanks to an abundance of filtering and card draw.<br />
        <br />
        Although Tobbo has chosen to include only one additional Power Card beyond the minimum of 25, Adapted Green Feln features no less than 14 card draw effects, including Seek Power. Assuming Tobbo is able to play at least two of these before Turn 7, his chances of drawing enough Influence to play Channel the Tempest on curve approach a more comfortable 80%. (See columns 10-12 on the chart, representing 10-12 draws beyond the opening hand when going first).<br />
        <br />
        The same can be said for Jotun Feast-Caller (PPP). While PPPP is among the most expensive Influence costs in Eternal, the Power Odds table shows us that hitting 8 Power can be even more difficult. The chances of drawing enough Influence and Power to play Channel the Tempest do not even become remotely favorable until after 14 draws. The same can be said for Sword of the Sky King.<br />
        <br />
        These examples illustrate why card draw is so important to decks that rely on 8-cost cards as a their win conditions.<br />
        <br />
        At the same time, Tobbo has also included plenty of filtering: every available crest within JPS is featured, along with 3x Cull the Deck 2x Strategize. In addition to mitigating power flood, this allows him to pass up any cards which may be too expensive to play in the early game.<br />
        <br />
        Much of this filtering does come at a price: 12 Undepleted Power Sources in the form of Crests.&nbsp;<img alt="Influence Chart" id="outmatched-powerbase" src="OutmatchedChartTrimmedJJ.jpeg" style="font-family: &quot;Open Sans Condensed Bold&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;, &quot;DejaVu Sans Mono&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Vera Sans Mono&quot;, monospace; font-size: 30px;" title="Influence Chart" /><span style="font-family: &quot;Open Sans Condensed Bold&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;, &quot;DejaVu Sans Mono&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Vera Sans Mono&quot;, monospace; font-size: 30px;">Mind Over Body</span></pg><pg> A 3-drop on <strong>Turn 2</strong> makes for a strong start, but what if <i>Initiate of the Sands</i> or <i>Seat of Progress</i> don&#39;t show up within the first couple of draws?<br />
        <br />
        Nishava still has plenty of options even without them.<br />
        <br />
        <em>Crownwatch Paladin </em>(<img alt="Justice" src="../epc/icon-justice.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" />) or <em>Awakened Student </em>(<em><img alt="Time" src="../epc/icon-time.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" /><img alt="Justice" src="../epc/icon-justice.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" /></em>) on <strong>Turn 2</strong> are just as likely to frustrate your opponent,&nbsp; if not more so.<br />
        <br />
        The chart shows us that the odds of drawing enough <strong>Influence</strong> to play either of these units on curve are in Nishava&#39;s favor: <img alt="Influence Chart" id="outmatched-powerbase" src="OutmatchedChartTrimmed2Drops.jpeg" title="Influence Chart" /> Note that the chances of playing <em>Crownwatch Paladin </em>are slightly better than for <em>Awakened Student</em>, and the <strong>Power Odds Table</strong> tells us why.<br />
        <br />
        To play <em>Awakened Student</em>&nbsp; you need to draw at least two <strong>Power</strong> and also two different <strong>Influence</strong> sources:&nbsp; both&nbsp; <img alt="Time" src="../epc/icon-time.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" /> and&nbsp; <img alt="Justice" src="../epc/icon-justice.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" />.&nbsp; For Nishava&#39;s first-place build, the combined odds of meeting each of these requirements after two draws are a healthy 87%.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <img alt="Influence Chart" id="outmatched-powerbase" src="OutmatchedPowerOdds.jpeg" title="Influence Chart" /><br />
        <br />
        Although <em>Crownwatch Paladin</em> requires the same amount of <strong>Power</strong> as <em>Awakened Student</em> - her <strong>Influence</strong> cost is less demanding, at a single <img alt="Justice" src="../epc/icon-justice.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" />. By consulting the table again we learn&nbsp; that the combined odds drawing enough <strong>Power</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>Influence</strong> to play <em>Crownwatch Paladin</em> after two draws are an even more comfortable 91%.&nbsp; </pg><br />
        <img align="left" alt="Teacher of Humility" src="Teacher_of_Humility.png" style="padding: 25px 15px; float: left; width: 294.75px;" title="Teacher of Humility" /><pg><h1g>Teacher of Humility</h1g>An aggressive deck like this one needs to be dropping units right out of the gate, and for the most part Nishava has a very good chance of doing just that on<strong> Turns 1</strong>, <strong>2</strong> and <strong>3</strong> .<br />
        <br />
        The exception is <em>Teacher of Humility, </em>a powerful 2-cost <img alt="Time" src="../epc/icon-time.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" /><img alt="Time" src="../epc/icon-time.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" /> unit that has made quite an impression in the early <strong>Fall of Argenport</strong> meta. Nishava has chosen to prioritize their <img alt="Justice" src="../epc/icon-justice.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" /><img alt="Justice" src="../epc/icon-justice.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" /> units over <em>Teacher </em>by including <strong>Time</strong> and<strong> Justice</strong> sources at a ratio of 21<img alt="Time" src="../epc/icon-time.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" />&nbsp; to 23 <img alt="Justice" src="../epc/icon-justice.png" style="width: 19px; height: 19px;" title="Justice" />.<br />
        <br />
        The odds of drawing enough <strong>Influence</strong> to play <em>Teacher</em> on curve trail behind the other 1 and 2-cost units by as much as 22%.<br />
        <br />
        Although this is a sizable gap, it makes sense because there are three times as many units requiring at least a single <strong>Justice</strong> influence.<br />
        <br />
        <em>Teacher of Humility</em> is an especially valuable tool in matchups where your opponent relies on a lot of extra card draw. But she doesn&#39;t necessarily need to be played on <strong>Turn 2</strong> in order to be effective for this deck&#39;s aggressive strategy. In this case, it is more important to make sure you have the resources needed to take an early lead in controlling the board.<br />
        <br />
        <h1g>Unmatched!</h1g> Nishava has constructed a very reliable, low-risk power base for <em>Rakano&#39;s weapons are outmatched!, </em>and this undoubtedly contributed to their success in <strong>Kaelari&#39;s Saturday Challenge</strong>. </pg><br />
