        		 <ats>
               Beyond the basics, a deeper understanding of <a href="" target="_blank">Eternal's</a> rules for draws, <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>Influence</strong> will give you a deck-building advantage</ats>
    <br />

			<atsub>
        A closer look at how starting order, Mulligans, and Wild Cards can impact your Power base
	    </atsub>

	        <a href="images/VeteranStrategies.jpeg" style="background-color: rgb(23, 20, 29);" target="_blank"><img alt="Graphic" src="images/VeteranStrategies.jpeg" style="position: absolute; left: 80px; top: 210px; width: 250px; height: 164px;" /></a>

      Import your deck into the Eternal Power Calculator for an instant snapshot of how you can expect your Power base to perform in a game of Eternal. Add or remove cards from the list and you will immediately see the impact of these changes on the fly. <br />
	        <br />

      Once you have mastered these basic concepts, you will gain an even better understanding  of your brews by considering the specific rules of Power, Influence and draws in Eternal and how they shape probabilities.

			<ath>On the Play or On the Draw?</ath>
			<atsub>Your odds of holding Power and Influence increase<br /> when you go second</atsub>

          <br />

          The user’s guide to the Power Calculator describes the value of thinking in terms of draws rather than turns. One of the most obvious applications of this occurs before you have even seen your first card. Are you going first or are you going second?
          <br /><br />
          The values in Column 1 of the Power Calculator represent your first turn if you are “on the play” (going first). Players “on the draw” (going second) receive an additional card draw as part of their opening hand.
          <br /><br />
          So if you want a better indication of how your Power base performs when on the draw, simply skip to Column 2 and observe that your odds of holding Power and Influence increase. This is compensation for the disadvantage of your opponent taking a turn before yours.
	        <br />

          <br /><br />

          <ath>Eternal’s rules for redraws (aka Mulligans)</ath>
    			<atsub>Your odds of holding Power and Influence increase when you redraw your opening hand</atsub>
          <br /><br />
          At the start of each game, both players are given an option to keep or redraw the cards they have been dealt in what is commonly referred to as the Mulligan phase. Your odds of holding Power and Influence in your opening hand will never be lower than what is displayed on the Eternal Power Calculator. However - if you decide to redraw - your chances of drawing Power and Influence will increase.
          <br /><br />
          There are a number of factors that determine how much of an increase occurs. But it helps to keep in mind that the range of drawing your Power and Influence sources relative to each other remains unchanged. In other words: if you have constructed your Power base to prioritize Fire on Turn 1 or double Time on Turn 2, these priorities will remain proportionally consistent regardless of Eternal’s redraw rules.

          <ath>Wild Cards</ath>
    			<atsub>Your odds of holding Influence both increase and decrease when using Wild Cards</atsub>
          <br /><br />
          A handful of Power sources in Eternal behave very differently from the rest by granting you an Influence of your choice. The Power Calculator accurately predicts your chances of holding the right cards to reach particular Power and Influence requirements after a specific number of draws. It has no way of calculating the decisions you make as a pilot - including the order in which you play those cards.
